From the day you were born, you've been invincible
For centuries, the Tyrant has made life miserable
Youâ€™ve discovered that your body is completely indestructible
Seemingly honorable it would be easy to mistake you as chivalrous
A few weeks later, a letter arrives, explaining that you are unique
After taking a pill, you suddenly realize that it all was intentional
Unfortunately, their ideas about your past life are hilariously inaccurate
A rather mundane day changes when you unearth something quite interesting
But times are hard, and silver bullets are expensive
Whenever the sun goes away, he stays up there keeping the magic alive
